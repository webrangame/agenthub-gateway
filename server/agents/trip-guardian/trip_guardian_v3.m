If the destination is missing/unknown, briefly ask for the city and stop.

If reviews are available:
- Extract Insider Tips (specific, actionable)

If reviews are not available or API fails:
- Do NOT output 'MISSING'; instead, provide general, safe, non-invented traveler tips for the city (common well-known highlights, neighborhoods, and caution areas if broadly known).
- Keep it concise and clearly note: 'No live reviews fetched; providing general guidance.'"

Safety Briefing for ${extractCity_output}.

User trip: ${input}
Extracted details: ${extractDetails_output}

If destination is missing/unknown: briefly ask for the city and stop.

If destination is known:
1. State: 'No verified live news data available in this run (as of execution time).'
2. Provide common, well-known safety risks for ${extractCity_output}.
