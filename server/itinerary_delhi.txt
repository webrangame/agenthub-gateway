The traveler arrives in Delhi in the early afternoon and takes the Airport Express Metro to a hotel near Rajiv Chowk, checking in and refreshing before a light lunch at Karim’s for classic Mughlai fare. After lunch they enjoy a relaxed evening walk past India Gate and the Rashtrapati Bhavan promenade, then dine on aloo‑paratha in Old Delhi’s Paranthe Wali Gali before retiring early to adjust to the time zone.

The next morning begins with a wholesome breakfast at the hotel, followed by a guided rickshaw tour of Old Delhi that visits the Red Fort, Jama Masjid, and the bustling lanes of Chandni Chowk; modest dress and shoe removal are observed at the mosque. A midday lunch of butter chicken is taken in Karol Bagh, after which the traveler returns to the hotel for a short rest to avoid the peak heat. In the early afternoon they explore Humayun’s Tomb and the tranquil Lodhi Gardens, then pause for masala chai and golgappa in Khan Market, staying alert to pickpockets. The evening concludes with a cultural showcase at Dilli Haat, a dinner of premium kebabs at Bukhara, and a Metro ride back to the hotel.

On the third day the itinerary shifts to modern Delhi: after breakfast at The Imperial, the traveler visits the Lotus Temple and the spectacular Akshardham complex, both of which have security checks and no large bags allowed. A coffee break in Connaught Place follows, then a leisurely shopping session at Select Citywalk in Saket, providing an air‑conditioned respite. Lunch is a light South‑Indian meal at Sagar Ratna. In the afternoon the traveler takes a brief health check at a Metro checkpoint, then watches the sunset at India Gate before a farewell dinner at Indian Accent, where a reservation is recommended. If desired, a nightcap at the piano bar in The Leela can be added before the final night’s rest.

The departure morning starts with an early light breakfast, a prompt checkout, and a Metro ride back to Indira Gandhi International Airport, allowing ample time for security and boarding. Throughout the stay the traveler should carry an N95/KN95 mask for Delhi’s moderate‑to‑unhealthy air quality, wear a light sweater for cool mornings, use sunscreen, and keep a cross‑body bag or money belt to deter pickpockets. Metro travel is preferred over road transport to avoid traffic congestion, while Uber or pre‑booked taxis are recommended for any trips outside the Metro network. Modest clothing is required at religious sites, shoes should be removed where appropriate, and the client should stay hydrated and avoid strenuous outdoor activity during peak smog hours (07:00‑10:30 and 17:00‑20:00).
